                            <p>Painting is an art form which surfaces images to canvas or other materials by applying
                                paints, pigments and other medium. There are several different media used for painting
                                like oils, acrylics, watercolor etc. It requires
                                creative skills to paint images on canvas or any other surface. There are various stages
                                of painting that include preparing the surface, under-painting or blocking in colors,
                                laying the paint, and blending colors. Additional
                                layers of paint are applied to the surface in order to build up complex colors. </p>

                            <p>Painting is fun when you don&#8217;t give it the kind of importance that you give your
                                studies or any other work. This way it can be enjoyed like a break from your regular
                                stressful routine. Paint whenever you feel like, for
                                no reason at all and see how it helps you unwind.</p>
                            <p><strong>Painting in Modern Times:</strong> Artworks have been produced by computers for a
                                long time now. In the beginning, it was mostly used to generate technical drawings and
                                research papers by scientists and engineers. However,
                                with the advent of digital photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop and Corel Draw,
                                artists started using computers to make their paintings look more realistic, to create
                                various effects like colors blending in the air.</p>
                            <p>Nowadays, many artists use 3D software like Maya and Z-Brush to create their artworks.
                                Maya is used by many 3D animators, video game developers and VFX (Visual effects)
                                artists, etc. Z-Brush is a digital sculpting software
                                which allows artists to create 3D models from scratch.</p>

                            <p>Painting is a very nice hobby, so students should definitely be encouraged to follow
                                painting. Painting develops the skills of creative thinking and expression which are
                                necessary for everyone.</p>
                            <p>Painting has been used as a form of art since centuries. Painting has been and will
                                continue to be used as a way to express thoughts and experiences, depict memories and
                                different emotions associated with the painting, provide
                                inspiration to people who love creative arts etc.</p>
                            <p>There is nothing wrong with painting, if it is done by children. Painting can help them
                                to develop their creativity, imagination and hand-eye coordination. They can even learn
                                to paint by numbers once they are familiar with
                                the various painting tools. Then they can paint on their own. Children don&#8217;t waste
                                time while painting, instead they learn to make the best use of their idle time.</p>

                            <p>Anyone can learn how to paint. Painting is a very nice hobby that everyone should try at
                                least once in their life. It doesn&#8217;t matter how old or young you are, you can
                                always try your hand at painting.</p>
                            <p>It is true that some people just naturally seem to be better than others in terms of
                                skill and creativity, but there are many artists who have not even received formal
                                training, yet they paint very beautifully. According to
                                me anyone can learn how to paint.</p>
                            <p>You should always begin with small canvases, until you get used to handling paints,
                                brushes etc. You should be able-bodied enough to carry out all of your painting
                                activities without getting tired too soon which might lead
                                to your paintings being sloppy. Try different styles and themes. There is no end to
                                creativity and imagination, so don&#8217;t limit yourself with a particular style or
                                theme. You can always try your hand at something new.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <img

                            <p>
                                The “lead” pencil is familiar to everyone, however, it is not and never was made from
                                lead but from graphite, a type of carbon that is mixed with clay and baked. Graphite
                                pencils are best sharpened using a sharp craft knife rather than a pencil sharpener.
                                They are graded from hard (H) to soft (B). 9H is the hardest whereas 9B is the softest,
                                with F (for fine) and HB in the middle range. H pencils (2H, 3H, and 4K; they
                                progressively become harder) are good for clear-cut,
                                light lines, but will scratch into the surface of your paper, so B pencils are better
                                for softer, tonal work.</p>
                            <p>Each grade of pencil will only produce a tone of a given darkness and no amount of
                                pressure will make that tone darker. If you require a darker tone, you will need to
                                switch to a softer grade of pencil. Soft pencils will give
                                a greater range of tones than hard pencils and can be erased without leaving an indent
                                should you make a mistake. It is for this reason that most drawings are made using a
                                pencil which is HB or softer. Aim to use a 2B or
                                3B to start your drawing and switch to a softer—or blacker—pencil, such as a 6B or a 9B,
                                for deeper tones.</p>
                            <p>Most mechanical pencils, also known as clutch or propelling pencils, are good for
                                precision work, but the softest grades are not easy to find.
                            </p>

                            <p>Pastel pencils are made from a strip of hard pastel secured in a wooden barrel. Avoid
                                dropping them since the soft pigment strip breaks easily. These pencils are harder than
                                soft pastels and look like colored pencils, although
                                they have a scratchier, chalkier feel. They are good for detailed line work, as well as
                                shading, as they are non-waxy and can be blended well.</p>
                            <p>The mark made with a pastel pencil is not permanent and will need to be sprayed with a
                                fixative (see more on fixatives below). These pencils are very easy to work with. There
                                is a wide variety of strong colors available. They
                                are perfect not only for finished drawings, but also for quick sketches and are
                                especially effective when used on a colored paper.</p>

                            <p>Conté sticks, crayons, and pencils are natural pigments bound with gum Arabic. Conté
                                sticks (also known as carré sticks) and hard chalks or pastels are ideal for making
                                colored sketches. The most popular colors are earth tones—white,
                                black, grays, browns, and rusts, such as sanguine (a reddish brown) and sepia—but they
                                are also available in a wide range of other colors. They work particularly well on
                                colored paper and can be used with other dry drawing
                                media. While the pencils are more suitable for line work, the sticks can be used to
                                block in larger areas of tone. They can be smudged and blended but are not easily
                                erased.</p>
                            <p>A wide range of conté pencils are available in the traditional colors of black, white,
                                sepia, sanguine, terra-cotta, and bistre (a grayish brown). Artists’ pencils resemble
                                traditional graphite pencils but are also available
                                with a rectangular profile. Some of the pencils have a wax content that enables them to
                                be used without fixing, but other pencils are chalkier and will require fixative
                                protection.</p>

                            <p>These are essentially charred wood and are one of the oldest drawing materials. Made from
                                carbonized wood (usually willow, but beech and vine can also be found), the sticks are
                                graded as soft or hard and come in four thicknesses:
                                thin, medium, thick, and extra thick sticks. (Extra-thick sticks are also known as
                                “scene painters’ charcoal.”) Thin sticks work well for fur, feathers, and other fine
                                detail, while block charcoal works well for large areas.</p>
                            <p>
                                Compressed charcoal, also known as Siberian charcoal, is made into a pencil with either
                                wooden or rolled paper barrels, and is cleaner to use than traditional stick charcoal.
                                It is graded by hardness and density and can be found with both round and square
                                profiles. They produce darker, sharper lines, which are difficult to smudge or blend.
                            </p>
                            <p>Sharpen all charcoal by using a sharp utility knife or by using a fine-grade sandpaper.
                                Charcoal dust sits delicately on the support surface and will need fixing to avoid being
                                smudged.

                                A very large range of pen options is available—so much so that it may seem a little
                                overwhelming. Technical pens are convenient to use for fast sketches, but their nibs
                                make unvarying marks. Fountain or cartridge pens, roller-ball, ballpoint, fineliners,
                                and specialist art pens come with a wide range of nibs and can be used for both quick
                                sketches and more detailed drawings. Ballpoint pens can be smooth and satisfying to use
                                and are convenient for sketching. All pens can
                                create fine, flowing lines, with smooth and subtle results.</p>
                            <p>Although there are so many pen types, most have the same drawback—the size or width of
                                the line from a pen is fixed. It is important when using these pens to experiment in
                                order to find what is or is not possible. The pens
                                deliver essentially linear marks, and tone is only achieved through some form of
                                hatching or cross-hatching. Some pens, however, use water-soluble inks making it
                                possible to pull out tone from the line work by using water.
                                Pens that use water-soluble inks are especially useful as it is possible to rewet areas
                                to lighten the line work and pull out areas of tone.
