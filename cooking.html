                            <p>Before the pandemic, we were cooking less and less. Research suggests
                                that a decline was underway in home cooking, cooking skills and
                                confidence in a number of countries including the UK to the USA, Canada
                                and Australia. Public
                                health agencies were increasingly promoting cooking from scratch because
                                of its connection to better diets. However, a lack of time restricted
                                people’s ability to use these cooking and food skills. Now COVID-19 has
                                caused
                                a dramatic shift in our food practices (as in so many areas of life).
                                New trends, such as a wave of people turning to breadmaking, suggested
                                that for a number of people, the pandemic had freed up time to focus on
                                food preparation.

                            <p></p>
                            <p>According to a survey of people residing in five European economies, the
                                vast majority of consumers will be relying on home-cooked meals for
                                their dinner either more, or the same amount, after Covid-19. The
                                research from Bain
                                & Company found that around 40% of people said they would be eating home
                                cooked meals as much as before, while the same number said they would
                                eat home cooking more often.</p>
                            <img
                                src="https://www.consultancy.uk/illustrations/news/detail/2020-08-21-204406654-Meal-occasions.jpg">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>For some of us, extra time at home means a chance to try new recipes,
                                hone cooking skills, and cook up a creative storm in the kitchen. For
                                others, cooking in confinement involves throwing together quick, easy,
                                nutritious meals
                                that can feed a family.</p>
                            <p>What we eat affects both our physical and mental health. Now more than
                                ever, it’s important to keep your energy levels up; stay hydrated by
                                drinking plenty of water; and make sure your body gets all the nutrients
                                it needs by
                                maintaining a healthy balanced diet.</p>
                            <p>Planning in advance, involving the whole family, and having some quick
                                and easy recipes to hand can make cooking less of a chore and more of a
                                pleasure.</p>

                            <h2><u>Benefits of Cooking</u></h2>
                            <p>When it comes to providing your body with healthy nutrition, nothing
                                beats home cooked meals. Let’s see the top five reasons homemade meals
                                are the better alternative:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cheaper than eating out</li>
                                <p>Pre-packed meals (and of course eating at restaurants) will always
                                    cost more than a similar homemade option. Best of all, if you cook
                                    extra portions and eat them for lunch, you will save even more. You
                                    can also boost your
                                    savings by buying your food in bulk or when food items are on sale.
                                    Freezing is the simplest method to keep foods for longer periods of
                                    time, but you can also process certain foods to make them last
                                    longer, for instance
                                    pickling fresh produce. Just get creative and you can extend their
                                    shelf life.</p>
                                <li>Spend more family time at home</li>
                                <p>Eating at home means less time wasted in traffic, waiting for your
                                    order at the restaurant, and then getting back into traffic to drive
                                    home. Let’s not forget the money you have to spend on petrol and
                                    parking. All that
                                    time could have gone into making a delicious multi-course meal from
                                    scratch. If you have a busy schedule on weekdays, you can always
                                    prepare the week’s meals during the weekends, apportion them out and
                                    freeze them.
                                    This means you only need to heat up the necessary portions when you
                                    get home after a busy day at work.</p>
                                <li>More healthy seasoning</li>
                                <p>Cooking your own meals you get to choose the ingredients that make up
                                    the dishes, for example leaner meat and more vegetables. You can
                                    certainly control the amount of fat, salt, and sugar that goes into
                                    every meal. For
                                    the more adventurous, you can make fantastic tasting dishes by using
                                    local herbs and spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, parsley, serai,
                                    daun purut, ketumbar and such.</p>
                                <li>Easier to plan balanced and nutritious meals</li>
                                <p>Being able to plan your weekly menu means you can create meals that
                                    are properly balanced. Having a balanced weekly menu will ensure
                                    your body’s nutrition needs are fulfilled, leading to fewer cravings
                                    for unhealthy options.
                                    Such investments in a healthy diet are the way to healthier you and
                                    your family members.</p>
                                <li>Be kind to your gut</li>
                                <p>Home cooking also means you get to determine the level of hygiene
                                    yourself – no more worries about plates not being cleaned properly,
                                    dirty food preparation areas or ingredients not being fresh anymore.
                                    You have full control
                                    over what goes into your body. By minimising the risk of pathogenic
                                    bacteria growing in your food, you also place a lower burden on your
                                    gut.</p>


                            </ol>
