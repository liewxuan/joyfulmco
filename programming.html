							<h2 id="what-is-programming">What is Programming?</h2>
							<p><span>In this blog post, we will decipher the term “programming” and understand its usage and many
									other related terms.</span></p>
							<h2 id="understanding-programming-in-layman-terms"><strong>Understanding Programming in Layman
									terms</strong></h2>
							<blockquote>
								<p><em><span>Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.</span></em></p>
							</blockquote>
							<p><span>Confusing? Let us understand the definition deeply.</span></p>
							<p><strong>“Instruct the computer”</strong><span>: this basically means that you provide the computer a
									set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instructions
									could be of various types. For example:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Adding 2 numbers,</span></li>
								<li><span>Rounding off a number, etc.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<p><span>Just like we humans can understand a few languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, etc.), so
									is the case with computers. Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific
									syntactical form called a programming language.</span></p>
							<p><strong>“Perform various tasks”</strong><span>: the tasks could be simple ones like we discussed above
									(adding 2 numbers, rounding off a number) or complex ones which may involve a sequence of multiple
									instructions. For example:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Calculating simple interest, given principal, rate and time.</span></li>
								<li><span>Calculating the average return on a stock over the last 5 years.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<p><span>The above 2 tasks require complex calculations. They cannot usually be expressed in simple
									instructions like adding 2 numbers, etc.</span></p>
							<p><span>Hence, in summary, Programming is a way to tell computers to do a specific task.</span></p>
							<h2 id="why-should-you-bother-about-coding"><strong>Why should you bother about coding?</strong></h2>
							<p><span>You must be wondering - why does one need a computer for adding or rounding off numbers? Or even
									for simple interest calculation? After all, even an 8th standard kid can easily do such things even
									over large numbers. What is programming used for? What benefits do computers offer?</span></p>
							<p>Well, computers offer so many benefits:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Computers are fast</strong><span><strong>:</strong> computers are amazingly fast. If you
										know how to properly utilize the power of Computer programming, you can do wonders with it. For a
										typical computer of today’s time, an addition of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each
										takes hardly a nanosecond. Read again - nanosecond! That means that in 1 second, a computer can
										perform about a billion additions. Can any human ever do that? Forget a billion additions a second,
										typical human can’t even do 10 additions per second. So, computers offer great speed.</span></li>
								<p></p>
								<li><strong>Computers are cheap</strong><span><strong>:</strong> if you were a stock market analyst and
										you had to monitor the data of say 1000 stocks so that you can quickly trade them. Imagine the
										hassle that would create if you were to do it manually! It is just impractical. While you are
										performing your calculation on the stock’s performance, the price may change. The other alternative
										is to hire people so that you can monitor more stocks in parallel. That means your cost goes up
										significantly. Not to mention the trouble you will face if some of your employees commit a
										calculation error in the process. You may end up losing money! Contrast that with the case where you
										use a computer. Computers can process a huge amount of information quickly and reliably. 1000 stocks
										are nothing for computers in the 21st century.</span></li>
								<p></p>
								<li><strong>Computers can work 24x7</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Computers can work 24x7 without
										getting exhausted. So, if you have a task that is big enough, you can without worries allocate it to
										a computer by programming it and sleep peacefully.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<h2 id="why-should-you-learn-computer-programming"><strong>Why should you learn Computer
									Programming?</strong></h2>
							<p><span>Now, after knowing so many things about programming, the big question to be answered is - why
									should you learn Computer Programming? Let us understand why:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Programming is fun</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Using Programming, you can create your
										own games, your personal blog/profile page, a social networking site like Facebook, a search engine
										like Google or an e-commerce platform like Amazon! Won’t that be fun? Imagine creating your own game
										and putting it on Play Store and getting thousands and thousands of downloads!</span></li>
								<li><strong>The backbone of a Technology Company</strong><span><strong>:</strong> The backbones of
										today’s technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and many others, are
										giant computer programs written by a collaboration of thousands of skilled programmers. If you have
										the right business acumen, knowing programming can help you create the next big tech company.</span>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Pretty good salary</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Computer Programmers are paid extremely
										well almost all across the world. Top programmers in Silicon Valley make millions of dollars every
										year. Quite a few companies offer to start salaries as high as $100,000 per year.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<br></br>
							<h2><u>Compiled and Interpreted Language</u></h2>
							<p>There are two types of programming languages - Compiled Languages and Interpreted Languages.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>A <strong>compiled language</strong> is a programming language which are generally compiled and not
								interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target
								machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans.</p>
							<p>Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>An <strong>interpreted language</strong> is a programming language which are generally interpreted,
								without compiling a
								program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the
								target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>Interpreted language ranges –
								JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.</p>
							<h2 id="advantages-of-compiled-languages">Advantages of compiled languages</h3>
								<p>Programs that are compiled into native machine code tend to be faster than interpreted code. This is
									because the process of translating code at run time adds to the overhead, and can cause the program to
									be slower overall.</p>
								<h2 id="disadvantages-of-compiled-languages">Disadvantages of compiled languages</h3>
									<p>The most notable disadvantages are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing</li>
										<li>Platform dependence of the generated binary code</li>
									</ul>
									<h2 id="advantages-of-interpreted-languages">Advantages of interpreted languages</h3>
										<p>Interpreted languages tend to be more flexible, and often offer features like dynamic typing and
											smaller program size. Also, because interpreters execute the source program code themselves, the
											code
											itself is platform independent.</p>
										<h2 id="disadvantages-of-interpreted-languages">Disadvantages of interpreted languages</h3>
											<p>The most notable disadvantage is typical execution speed compared to compiled languages.</p>
											<p></p>
											<p>Actually, most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations –
												the
												language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted. However, for simplicity’s sake,
												they’re typically referred to as such.

												Python, for example, can be executed as either a compiled program or as an interpreted language
												in interactive mode. On the other hand, most command line tools, CLIs, and shells can
												theoretically be classified as interpreted languages.</p>
											<p></p>
											<h3>Top Programming Languages</h3>
											<p>This is a list of the popular programming languages at December 2021.</p>
											<p><strong>TIOBE Index</strong>: TIOBE ratings are calculated by counting hits of the most popular
												search engines. Twenty-five search engines are used to calculate the TIOBE index. The TIOBE
												Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The
												index started in the year 2001 and updated once a month.</p>
											<p><strong>PYPL Index</strong>: The PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index is created by
												analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google. The index is updated once a
												month.</p>

											<img src="assets/img/top-programming-language-2.jpg">
											<p>If you're excited by the data and logic side of coding, you may wish to learn Python, Java, C,
												C++ or C#. If you're jazzed about visual design and user interfaces, TypeScript might be up your
												alley. And if you're looking to develop mobile apps, you'd want to check out Java for Android,
												and Swift or Objective-C for Apple's iOS.

												ongoing
												process. Your options are practically limitless, so it may be helpful to make a list of your
												preferences and then searching for the IDE that most closely matches your needs. While every
												developer has their favorite software, don't be afraid to branch out as the world of IDEs is
												always expanding.</p>
