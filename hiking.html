                            <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside.
                                Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious
                                pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking
                                long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions. </p>
                            <br></br>
                            <h2><u>Hiking Equipments</u></h2>
                            <p>There are so many places to find your perfect hiking trail, from mountain trails to
                                coastal paths. Maybe you want to discover new horizons or explore the surroundings
                                around your base camp, take a break after a busy week, push
                                yourself, or get lost in the sights and sounds of nature. Whatever drives you, your gear
                                shouldn’t be a burden. In this article we’ll discuss everything you need to make your
                                equipment work for whatever adventure you pursue.
                                Essentials only. Keep that pack light!</p>
                            <h5>Map and Compass</h5>
                            <img src=" assets/img/map.jpg" alt="Map ">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Taking the necessary time to look at a map before heading out on trail can help
                                you assess and plan for what is ahead, and it can potentially save your life.
                                Understanding the basic elements of a map can empower you to stay
                                found, and know what's around you as you navigate safely from point A to point B
                                while on trail.</p>
                            <h5>Sunglasses, Sun Cream and a Sun Hat </h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/sunglasses.jpg" alt="Sunglasses">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Prolonged or intense exposure to the sun can cause painful sunburns in the short
                                term, and in the long term, increases one's risk of skin cancer, and possibly
                                hasten the onset of skin damage. Excess exposure to UV radiation
                                can cause a burn on the corneas of your eyes (ouch!), and long-term exposure can
                                lead to issues such as cataracts and macular degeneration.</p>
                            <h5>First-Aid Kit </h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/first-aid-kit.png" alt="First-Aid Kit">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Fast response. Having a first aid kit ready in your pack when hiking can help
                                prevent an injury from getting worse and can potentially save any trips to a
                                walk in clinic or hospital. This is especially crucial, if an injury
                                involves blood-loss. They help you treat ailments on the trail, thus minimizing
                                the risk of infection or injury severity. A well-stocked kit contains items that
                                treat burns, injuries, scrapes, and cuts.</p>
                            <h5>Headlamp and/or Handheld Torch </h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/torch.jpg" alt="Torch">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>You'll also find a flashlight useful in emergencies, especially since you can
                                flash it strategically to make a distress signal. Hiking with a headlamp is
                                ideal if you're hiking towards your tent or a safe place out in the wild.
                                Using a headlamp will leave your hands free to do other activities such as
                                collecting wood, picking up edibles, or even prepping up your sleeping area.</p>
                            <h5>Food and Drinks </h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/food.jpg" alt="Food">
                            <p></p>
                            <p>
                                Any outdoor activity requires more energy than your usual daily activities. In
                                order to be able to enjoy and endure the increased need for energy, your body
                                will need more water and food. The food you choose to bring with you on a hike
                                will fuel you throughout
                                the day. Hiking snacks are a must-have on the trail. They'll keep you going
                                throughout the day and provide you with that much needed energy required to get
                                to where you're going.</p>
                            <br></br>

                            <h2><u>Famous Hiking Trails in Malaysia</u></h2>
                            <p>Ready to rise to the challenge? Malaysia is home to breathtaking mountains, lush
                                national parks and scenic landscapes that would excite any adventurous soul. The
                                time it takes to complete each trail may differ depending on
                                your fitness level and chosen trail, but this should give a rough indication of
                                what to expect.</p>
                            <h5>1. Bukit Tabur</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/bukit-tabur.jpg">
                            <p>Part of the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge (visible from Kuala Lumpur), Bukit Tabur is
                                one of the most beautiful hiking trails in the Klang Valley. It is split into
                                two distinct trails, Bukit Tabur East, and Bukit Tabur West. Both
                                trails offer breathtaking views along the way, although the west side is often
                                slightly more popular, especially during the weekends.</p>
                            <p>While neither trail is particularly difficult, they are both laden with quarts
                                and slippery, rocky slopes. Because of this, you should definitely come with the
                                appropriate footwear. If you make it to the top, an incredible
                                sight awaits you, one that perfectly captures the dualistic beauty of Kuala
                                Lumpur. The east trail ends with a panoramic view of the verdant hills while the
                                western summit shows you a stunning view of the cityscape!</p>
                            <h5>2. Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM)</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/frim.jpg">
                            <p>Out of all the places for hiking in Malaysia, FRIM is arguably one of the most
                                frequented on the Peninsula. That&#8217;s because this forest reserve is located
                                right on the outskirts of Kepong, just a short distance away from
                                the Kuala Lumpur city centre. This pristine natural haven is perfect for
                                cycling, hiking, and simply escaping the hustle and bustle of city life.</p>
                            <p>The hiking trails here are relatively easy. There are no steep ascents or
                                battling with rocky terrain here, only leisurely strolls under the welcome shade
                                of the verdant forest trees. The Rover Track is one of the most popular
                                trails and if it&#8217;s your first time, this is where you want to start.
                                However, take note that FRIM is more suited for locals so there is little
                                signage to help you navigate.</p>
                            <h5>3. Gunung Datuk</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/gunung-datuk.jpg">
                            <p>Gunung Datuk is located in the foresty hills of Negeri Sembilan, about an hour
                                and a half away from Kuala Lumpur. Compared to most other hiking trails on this
                                list, Gunung Datuk is slightly more challenging. It is also more
                                time-consuming with the average time needed to complete the hike being about
                                seven hours (both ways).</p>
                            <p>The terrain features a mixture of inclines and rocky slopes along with verdant,
                                forested ascents. The final ascent also required you to climb up a few ladders
                                mounted on some massive rocks! While it is a challenging climb,
                                reaching the top rewards you with a truly magnificent sight. A panoramic view of
                                the ambient town of Rembau is on offer. If you time your visit right,
                                you&#8217;ll even see plenty of rainbows, an effect of the morning dew
                                in the area.</p>
                            <h5>4. Gunung Kinabalu</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/gunung-kinabalu.jpg">
                            <p>Gunung Kinabalu needs no introduction. It is the tallest mountain in Malaysia and
                                the third highest peak in Southeast Asia. When you talk about hiking in
                                Malaysia, you simply can&#8217;t leave this majestic mammoth of a mountain
                                out of the picture! Located in Kinabalu National Park (itself an awesome jungle
                                trekking experience), Mount Kinabalu is easily the most challenging hiking trail
                                in Malaysia.</p>
                            <p>Ascending this UNESCO World Heritage Site is no mean feat and often takes about
                                two full days to complete a round trip. You will also need to book a climb
                                through a local tour/hiking company as the ascent can be a little precarious,
                                especially for beginners. Along the way, you&#8217;ll get to experience the full
                                beauty of Malaysia&#8217;s flora and fauna, before being absolutely blown away
                                by the unparalleled views at the very top. At that moment,
                                you&#8217;ll realise that all that hard work was more than worth it. Although,
                                at this point, you may also want an ice pack for your sore limbs!</p>
                            <h5>5. Broga Hill</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/broga-hill.jpg">
                            <p>Broga Hill, located in the sleepy town of Semenyih, Selangor, is one of my
                                personal favourite spots for hiking in Malaysia. It isn&#8217;t the toughest
                                hike you&#8217;ll ever experience but it IS one of the best places to catch
                                the sunrise in Malaysia. It takes about two hours to reach the summit and the
                                best time to set out, from experience, is around 4:30 in the morning. This gives
                                you ample time to catch the break of dawn.</p>
                            <p>You&#8217;ll want to bring torchlights and water for the trip. Though the hiking
                                trail is relatively smooth (with some rocky paths along the way), you&#8217;ll
                                still want to lace up comfortable shoes.</p>
                            <h5>6. Gunung Tok Wan</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/gunung-tok-wan.jpg">
                            <p>Sticking to hiking trails in Semenyih, Gunung Tok Wan is a steep mountain that
                                lies just beyond the trail of Broga Hill. Trust me, this is arguably one of the
                                toughest hiking trails in Malaysia, mainly because it STARTS at
                                the peak of Broga Hill! So after enjoying your lovely sunrise, instead of
                                heading back down for breakfast, you can simply continue your ascent to new
                                heights!</p>
                            <p>Thankfully, the distance between the peak of Broga Hill to Gunung Tok Wan is only
                                about 200 metres and you should be able to get there within an hour. At the top,
                                you&#8217;ll be able to admire the spawling expanse of Broga
                                Hill and the town of Semenyih in a spectacular panorama.</p>
                            <h5>7. Penang Hill</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/penang-hill.jpg">
                            <p>Here&#8217;s one of the places for hiking in Malaysia that is slightly
                                underrated. Penang Hill is one of the most famous destinations in the country.
                                However, most visitors will opt to ride the Penang Hill funicular to the
                                top (which, I admit, is a fun experience). What most tourists DON&#8217;T know
                                is that you can also hike around the hill by trekking through the Penang Hill
                                Loop trail.</p>
                            <p>The loop hike trail is about 11 kilometres long and takes about five hours to
                                complete. The trail is often rather steep and not always well marked, but there
                                is a fine view from the summit. Be prepared to traverse through dense
                                jungle trails though, which I suppose is one of the unique features of this
                                particular hike.</p>
                            <h5>8. Gunung Angsi</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/gunung-angsi.jpg">
                            <p>It’s said that Gunung Angsi is one of the easiest hiking trails in Malaysia. The
                                mountain is no taller than 825 meters and it doesn’t take longer than an hour
                                and a half to get to the summit. There are two hiking trails at
                                Gunung Angsi, accessible via the Ulu Bendul entrance and the Bukit Putus
                                entrance. The Ulu Bendul trail is slightly tougher as it is longer and features
                                some steep inclines.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of which trail you choose, they both converge at the same peak. The
                                top is a lovely clearing where you can simply lay on the ground and let the
                                sweet sounds of Mother Nature serenade you. While the view isn&#8217;t
                                as breathtaking as other hiking trails in Malaysia, it still makes for a
                                relaxing hike to put your mind at ease.</p>
                            <h5>9. Bukit Chenuang</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/bukit-chenuang.jpg">
                            <p>Bukit Chenuang is located near Hulu Langat, Selangor, and is one of the many
                                places for hiking in Malaysia that take you through forested paths filled with
                                rivers and verdant greenery. There are several trails that lead to
                                the summit, but one of the most interesting ones starts conveniently at Sungai
                                Congkak Recreational Forest. It takes about four hours to get to the summit, and
                                a little less to get back down.</p>
                            <h5>10. Gunung Ledang</h5>
                            <img src="assets/img/gunung-ledang.jpg">
                            <p>Finally, the tallest mountain peak in Johor, Gunung Ledang, also known as Mount
                                Ophir in English, is one of the most popular hiking trails in Malaysia. It lies
                                a short drive from Kuala Lumpur and features breathtaking natural
                                scenery and excellent views. Fit hikers can make it to the summit in less than
                                six hours.</p>
